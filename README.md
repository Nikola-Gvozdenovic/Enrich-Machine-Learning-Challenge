This dataset contains 100k transactions. A transaction is consisted of:
- transaction_description: string describing a transaction
- transaction_amount: the amount spent/received
- transaction_account_type: the type of account used in the transaction
The goal is to train the model that will be used to predict transaction_class for a given transaction.
